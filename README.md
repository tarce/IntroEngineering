# EGS 1006: Introduction To Engineering - CISE Files
---
#### Here you can find the files that were developed in class as well as the final example scripts.  

The Unix Folder/Directory holds the files that were developed in class.  These will run on UNIX systems including the machines in the CISE labs.  For other versions of the same files that run on alternate operating systems (e.g. Windows, MacOS), please visit the corresponding directories.  The table below also provides a brief description of each file.
